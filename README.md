Planner Website – A personal productivity web app that combines a calendar and a to-do list side by side to help organize daily tasks. I just called it “Planner.”

I built it because I wanted a simple site that would help with organizing and just for me to learn js, html, css

I made it using HTML for the layout and structure, CSS for design and positioning, and JavaScript to make the calendar. I coded it all in VS Code and hosted it on GitHub Pages.

The hardest part was making the dates on the calender and making sure the number of days were right. Through this project, I learned more about layout responsiveness.
